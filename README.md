# watson-voice-demo

Simple looping Web page allowing text entry, and selection of available voices from **Watson Text to Speech service** in [Bluemix](http://bluemix.net)

Launch the `/audio` link in a sound-capable browser - Chrome seems to work most reliably.

Launch the `/speak` link to see text entry and voice selection dialog
